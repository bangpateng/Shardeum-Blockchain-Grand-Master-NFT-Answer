## Level 4: Blockchain Architecture

D. All of the above
C. The 'Global State' represents the entire state of the blockchain at a given moment, the 'Current State' emphasizes its latest status, the 'Account State' pertains to individual balances, nonces, and related data for Ethereum addresses, and the 'Contract State' refers to the specific code and storage for smart contracts
C. Public blockchain
B. Bitcoin - Proof of Work (PoW), Ethereum - Proof of Stake (PoS)
B. ERC standards, like ERC-20 and ERC-721, are types of EIPs that specifically define token standards on Ethereum
A. Timestamp
A. Application Layer
D. B & C
C. They provide environments to simulate the blockchain network for testing purposes before deploying on the mainnet, which involves real world value
D. Automatically executing predefined instructions when specific conditions are met

## Level 5: Blockchain Features

D. Network congestion leading to high and unpredictable fees for end users
D. Scalability
B. Adding more low end machines/nodes
C. Throughput

A. Participants or computers that order, validate, relay, and store transactions and blocks in the network
D. Full nodes

## LEVEL 7 - BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE & COMPONENTS

D. All of the above
D. All of the above
A. They are back-end tools for developers to test/deploy smart contracts and dapps seamlessly to deliver decentralized products and services for end users
C. By fragmenting data into chunks and distributing them across nodes, ensuring redundancy and resistance to censorship without centralized control
B. By allowing users to create and broadcast transactions using cryptographic keys
A. Bitcoin - Bitcoin Core, Ethereum - Geth
B. On-chain solutions pertain to data and transactions stored directly on the main blockchain, while off-chain solutions involve data and transactions processed outside of the blockchain
C. Real-time event listening and data updates
B. Acting as a bridge between users and the blockchain network
A. Sharding

## LEVEL 8 - SMART CONTRACTS

A. Gas estimate is the estimated amount of gas that a transaction will require, while gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that a user is willing to spend on a transaction
C. Smart contracts are vulnerable to bug and other flaws in the code resulting in security breaches and loss of funds
B. Real-time weather updates
C. Gas Fee
A. A contract that autonomously performs a series of actions based on external data inputs and has multiple conditional outcomes.
D. All of the above
C. Smart contract programming language
A. Allow contracts to retrieve external world data
D. By taking advantage of poorly written contract code
B. Ethereum revolutionized the way real-world applications function by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications, eliminating the need for intermediaries

## LEVEL 9 - DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS (DAPPS)

D. All of the above
D. Smart Contracts facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, while dapps are the front-end interface of smart contracts
C. Automated Market Maker (AMM)
A. Bitcoin
B. iPhone App Store
C. Smart Contracts
A. Decentralized Application (Dapp)

C. Performance of the underlying (L1) blockchain

## LEVEL 10 - BLOCKCHAIN INTERFACES & UTILITIES

B. On-chain Analytics
C. Lightweight wallets don't store the entire blockchain but allow transactions, full-node wallets store and verify the entire blockchain, and third-party wallets are applications developed by external entities to manage keys and transact.
