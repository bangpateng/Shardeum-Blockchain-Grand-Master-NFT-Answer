# LEVEL 10 - BLOCKCHAIN INTERFACES & UTILITIES

_____ platforms aggregate and interpret vast amounts of on-chain data to produce useful metrics and insights about network health, economic activity, market sentiment, and more.
- B. On-chain Analytics

Which statement best describes the differences among lightweight wallets, full-node wallets, and third-party wallet applications in the context of blockchain?
- C. Lightweight wallets don't store the entire blockchain but allow transactions, full-node wallets store and verify the entire blockchain, and third-party wallets are applications developed by external entities to manage keys and transact.

_____  are blockchain systems that run parallel to a â€œmainchain" or L1 blockchain providing a mechanism to offload transactions from the mainchain, while performing their own consensus mechanism to reduce congestion and allow for faster processing times and interoperability.
- D. Sidechains

What role does a blockchain explorer play in the blockchain ecosystem?
- D. It enables users to view detailed information about blocks, transactions, and addresses

Why are oracles considered an important blockchain interface?
- A. They allow blockchains and its smart contracts to interact with external data sources

What is the use case of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-proofs) technology in blockchain?
- D. All of the above

What is the common objective that blockchain bridges, atomic swaps, and synthetics aim to achieve in the Web3 ecosystem?
- B. Facilitate seamless interactions or value transfer across different blockchains

Which of the following best describes the primary function of the MetaMask web browser extension?
- C. A wallet interface for interacting with Ethereum-based dapps

Which (Ethereum) Layer-2 scaling solution utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically ensure every transaction's correctness without requiring fraud verification windows or challenge periods?
- D. zk-Rollups

Which Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution processes transactions off-chain assuming them to be correct unless proven otherwise requiring a dispute resolution window?
- C. Optimistic Rollups
