# Level 5: Blockchain Features

What is a primary consequence of a blockchain network relying on high staking requirements and increased processing power (vertical scalability) while having limited throughput and scalability?
- D. Network congestion leading to high and unpredictable fees for end users

Which feature addresses the potential of a public blockchain to handle increased transaction loads?
- D. Scalability

Which of the below is an ideal and a highly decentralized solution for scalability issues in public blockchains?
- B. Adding more low end machines/nodes

Which feature ensures that transactions on the blockchain are processed quickly?
- C. Throughput

Which feature of blockchain and smart contract platform represents this statement “A decentralized exchange (DEX) can be combined with a decentralized lending protocol to create a new application that allows users to borrow and lend assets while also trading them.”
- D. Atomic Composability

Why is high fairness important in a blockchain network?
- B. It prevents certain participants from gaining undue advantage by manipulating transaction order

Which of the following best describes the average transactions per second (TPS) comparison between a centralized network like Visa and typical public blockchain networks?
- A. Visa processes significantly more transactions per second than public blockchain networks

In public blockchains, what permanent consequence occurs when validators fail to achieve consensus on the upcoming blocks or transactions to be appended?
- A. The blockchain splits into two separate chains (hard fork)

"Blockchain trilemma” or “Scalability trilemma," is a longstanding issue that hinders the mass adoption of blockchain networks. Which three features are encompassed by this trilemma in public blockchains?
- A. Security, decentralization and scalability

Which feature in blockchain ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed?
- D. Finality
