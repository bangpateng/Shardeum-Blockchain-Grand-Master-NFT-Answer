- D. All of the above

Which of the following are considered to be part of blockchain infrastructure?
- D. All of the above

Why are development tools/frameworks like Truffle, Hardhat and Anchor essential for blockchain development
- A. They are back-end tools for developers to test/deploy smart contracts and dapps seamlessly to deliver decentralized products and services for end users

In the evolving landscape of blockchain infrastructure, how do decentralized storage networks differentiate themselves from traditional data storage mechanisms?
- C. By fragmenting data into chunks and distributing them across nodes, ensuring redundancy and resistance to censorship without centralized control

How does a “wallet” primarily interface with the blockchain network
- B. By allowing users to create and broadcast transactions using cryptographic keys

Which of the following popular software clients are used for interacting with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains respectively?
- A. Bitcoin - Bitcoin Core, Ethereum - Geth

Which of the following best describes the difference between on-chain and off-chain solutions in the context of blockchain technologies?
- B. On-chain solutions pertain to data and transactions stored directly on the main blockchain, while off-chain solutions involve data and transactions processed outside of the blockchain

In the context of blockchain technology, what primary role do websockets play?
- C. Real-time event listening and data updates

What is the primary role of a wallet in blockchain?
- B. Acting as a bridge between users and the blockchain network

Which of the following is not considered a layer 2 solution in blockchain?
- A. Sharding
